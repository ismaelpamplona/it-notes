# Spawning More Threads Than CPU Cores

## Overview

If a CPU has 4 cores and you spawn 10 threads, the operating system will manage the execution of these threads using a process called **context switching**. Here’s what happens in detail:

## Context Switching

- **Concurrent Execution**: The 10 threads will not all run simultaneously since there are only 4 cores available. The operating system will schedule these threads to run on the available cores.
- **Time-Slicing**: The operating system will use time-slicing to give each thread a chance to execute. It rapidly switches between the threads, giving the illusion that they are running simultaneously.
- **Overhead**: Context switching introduces some overhead because the CPU needs to save and load the state of each thread. If there are too many threads, this overhead can become significant, potentially reducing performance.

## Example

Let’s look at an example to understand this better:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for _ in 0..5 {
                println!("Thread {} is running", i);
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

## What Happens

1. **Thread Creation**: 10 threads are created and started.
2. **CPU Core Management**: The 4 CPU cores will handle these 10 threads by time-slicing. At any given moment, only 4 threads can be executing instructions, while the others are waiting their turn.
3. **Context Switching**: The operating system switches between the threads frequently, saving the state of the thread currently running on a core and loading the state of the next thread to run.
4. **Execution**: Each thread prints its message and then sleeps for 500 milliseconds, allowing other threads to run during this sleep period.
5. **Completion**: The main thread waits for all spawned threads to complete using `handle.join().unwrap()`.

## Performance Considerations

- **Balanced Load**: If the workload is balanced (i.e., each thread performs similar tasks), the operating system can effectively manage the threads without significant performance degradation.
- **High Overhead**: If the number of threads is significantly higher than the number of CPU cores, the overhead from context switching can outweigh the benefits of concurrency, potentially reducing overall performance.
- **IO-Bound vs. CPU-Bound**: The impact of spawning more threads than cores depends on the nature of the tasks. IO-bound tasks (e.g., reading from disk, network operations) benefit more from multi-threading as they spend time waiting for IO operations to complete, allowing other threads to use the CPU. CPU-bound tasks (e.g., complex computations) can suffer more from the overhead of context switching.

## Summary

When you spawn more threads than the number of available CPU cores, the operating system will manage these threads using context switching, allowing all threads to make progress by sharing the available CPU cores. While this can improve performance and responsiveness in many scenarios, it also introduces overhead due to context switching, which can affect the overall efficiency, especially if the number of threads is significantly higher than the number of cores.
