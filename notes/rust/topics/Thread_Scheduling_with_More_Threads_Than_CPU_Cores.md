# Thread Scheduling with More Threads Than CPU Cores

## Overview

When you have more threads than CPU cores, the operating system's scheduler decides which threads to run and in what order. The specifics of thread scheduling depend on the operating system's scheduling algorithm, but here are some general principles:

## Thread Scheduling

1. **Priority**:
   - Some operating systems allow you to assign priorities to threads. Higher priority threads are more likely to be chosen to run first.

2. **Fairness**:
   - The scheduler aims to ensure that all threads get a fair share of CPU time, preventing any single thread from starving others.

3. **Round-Robin**:
   - One common scheduling algorithm is round-robin, where each thread is given a small time slice to run. After its time slice expires, the thread is put back in the queue, and the next thread gets its turn.

4. **Load Balancing**:
   - The scheduler may try to balance the load across all CPU cores, spreading the threads as evenly as possible.

## Example: Round-Robin Scheduling

Consider the following simplified example to illustrate how threads might be scheduled using a round-robin algorithm:

1. **Thread Queue**:
   - Initially, all 10 threads are placed in a queue: `[T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10]`.

2. **First Time Slice**:
   - The first 4 threads (`T1, T2, T3, T4`) are assigned to the 4 CPU cores and run for their time slice.

3. **Context Switching**:
   - After the first time slice, these threads are placed back in the queue: `[T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T1, T2, T3, T4]`.
   - The next 4 threads (`T5, T6, T7, T8`) are assigned to the CPU cores and run for their time slice.

4. **Continuation**:
   - This process continues until all threads have had their turn to run. The scheduler continuously cycles through the queue, giving each thread a chance to execute.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - The operating system initializes a queue with all the threads that need to run.
   - If thread priorities are used, the queue may be sorted based on priority.

2. **Assignment to Cores**:
   - The first 4 threads from the queue are assigned to the available CPU cores.
   - Each core runs its assigned thread for a specific time slice.

3. **Time Slice Expiration**:
   - After a thread's time slice expires, the operating system performs a context switch.
   - The state of the running thread is saved, and the next thread in the queue is loaded onto the core.

4. **Queue Management**:
   - The threads that have finished their time slice are moved to the back of the queue.
   - The next set of threads from the front of the queue is assigned to the cores.

5. **Repeat**:
   - The scheduler repeats this process, ensuring that each thread gets a chance to run.
   - The cycle continues until all threads have completed their tasks.

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficiency**: Proper scheduling ensures efficient CPU utilization by minimizing idle time and balancing the load across cores.
- **Overhead**: Context switching introduces overhead, so the scheduler aims to minimize unnecessary switches while ensuring fairness.
- **Responsiveness**: Time-slicing and prioritization help maintain responsiveness, especially in interactive or real-time systems.

## Summary

When you have more threads than CPU cores, the operating system's scheduler manages thread execution using techniques like round-robin scheduling, prioritization, and load balancing. This ensures that all threads get a chance to run, even if there are more threads than available CPU cores. The scheduler's goal is to optimize CPU utilization, maintain system responsiveness, and ensure fairness among threads.
