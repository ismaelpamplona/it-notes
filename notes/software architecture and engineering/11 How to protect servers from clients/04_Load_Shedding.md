# 4. Load Shedding

Imagine you have a magical toy factory, and sometimes there are too many orders for the factory to handle. To make sure the factory doesn’t get overwhelmed and stop working altogether, it decides to reject some of the orders. This process is called load shedding. In computer systems, load shedding is used to manage overwhelming amounts of traffic by rejecting some requests to maintain overall system performance.

Load shedding is like saying "no" to some tasks when there are too many to handle. It helps the system stay healthy and responsive by not trying to do more than it can manage.

## How to Implement Load Shedding in Distributed Systems:

1. **Define Thresholds:**

   - **What it is:** Set limits for how much load the system can handle.
   - **Example:** Decide the maximum number of requests a server can process at one time.

2. **Monitoring:**

   - **What it is:** Continuously monitor the system's performance metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and response times.
   - **Example:** Use tools like Amazon CloudWatch to keep an eye on how busy the servers are.

3. **Rejecting Requests:**

   - **What it is:** When the system exceeds the predefined thresholds, start rejecting new requests.
   - **Example:** If the server is too busy, it sends a message back saying it can’t process the request right now.

4. **Graceful Degradation:**

   - **What it is:** Ensure that when load shedding occurs, the system degrades gracefully, meaning essential services remain available, even if some less critical services are shed.
   - **Example:** A website might stop showing high-resolution images but still display text and important information.

5. **Prioritization:**

   - **What it is:** Decide which requests are more important and should be handled first.
   - **Example:** Handle requests from paying customers before handling those from free users.

6. **Rate Limiting:**

   - **What it is:** Limit the number of requests a user can make in a certain time period.
   - **Example:** Allow each user to make only 10 requests per minute.

## Important Considerations about Load Shedding:

1. **User Experience:**

   - **Impact:** Rejecting requests can affect user satisfaction.
   - **Consideration:** Implement clear messaging to inform users when the system is busy and when to try again.

2. **System Stability:**

   - **Impact:** Proper load shedding helps maintain system stability during high traffic.
   - **Consideration:** Ensure that critical services remain available even during load shedding.

3. **Fairness:**

   - **Impact:** Some users might be unfairly rejected more than others.
   - **Consideration:** Implement fair load shedding policies that distribute rejections evenly among users.

4. **Monitoring and Adjusting:**

   - **Impact:** The effectiveness of load shedding depends on accurate thresholds and rules.
   - **Consideration:** Continuously monitor performance and adjust thresholds as needed.

5. **Fallback Mechanisms:**

   - **Impact:** Users should have alternatives when requests are rejected.
   - **Consideration:** Provide fallback mechanisms, like redirecting to a less busy server or offering cached content.

## Summary

Load shedding is like a factory rejecting some orders to avoid being overwhelmed. In distributed systems, it helps maintain performance and stability by rejecting some requests when the system is too busy. Implementing load shedding involves setting thresholds, monitoring performance, rejecting excess requests, and prioritizing important tasks. It's essential to consider user experience, system stability, fairness, and having fallback mechanisms in place to ensure effective load shedding.
