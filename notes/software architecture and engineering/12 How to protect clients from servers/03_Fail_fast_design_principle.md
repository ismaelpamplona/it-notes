# 3. Fail-fast design principle

Imagine if you were playing a video game and your character hit a wall that you couldn't pass through. Instead of trying to move forward and getting stuck, the game immediately tells you that you can't go this way. This is similar to the fail-fast design principle in software. It means that if there's a problem, the system should immediately stop and let you know, instead of continuing and causing more issues.

## Fail-fast Principle:

- When something goes wrong, the system stops immediately and gives an error message.
- It's like your video game telling you right away that you can't go a certain way.

## Problems with Slow Services:

- **Chain Reactions:** One slow service can cause delays in other services that depend on it.
- **Cascading Failures:** When one service fails, it can cause a series of failures in other services.

## Characteristics of a Bad Service:

- **Low Availability:** The service often doesn't work.
- **Insecure:** The service can be easily hacked.
- **Poorly Tested:** The service has many bugs because it's not well tested.
- **Slow Performance:** The service takes too long to respond.

## Ways to Solve Problems with Slow Services:

1. **Timeouts:**

   - Set a time limit for how long to wait for a response. If the response takes too long, stop waiting.
   - Helps to minimize blocking time.

2. **Circuit Breaker:**

   - Like a fuse that stops requests to a failing service to prevent further issues.
   - Helps to identify and isolate a bad dependency.

3. **Health Checks:**

   - Regularly check if the service is working properly.
   - Helps to identify and isolate a bad dependency.

4. **Bulkhead:**

   - Divide the system into isolated sections so that a failure in one section doesn't affect the others.
   - Helps to minimize the impact of a bad dependency.

5. **Load Shedding:**

   - Drop some requests to protect the system from being overloaded.
   - Protects remaining servers from overload.

6. **Autoscaling:**

   - Automatically add more resources when the system is under heavy load.
   - Quickly adds redundant capacity.

7. **Monitoring:**

   - Keep an eye on the system to quickly identify and fix problems.
   - Quickly identifies and replaces failed servers.

8. **Chaos Engineering:**
   - Regularly test how the system handles failures.
   - Constantly tests server failures.

## Example in Software:

- **Fail-fast Scenario:**

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    Client->>Server: Send request
    Server-->>Client: Immediate error (fail-fast)
    Client->>Client: Handle error
  ```

- **Slow Service Scenario:**

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ServiceA
    participant ServiceB
    Client->>ServiceA: Send request
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: Forward request
    ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Slow response
    ServiceA-->>Client: Delayed response
  ```

## Summary

The fail-fast design principle is about stopping immediately when something goes wrong, rather than continuing and causing more problems. It helps prevent chain reactions and cascading failures in systems. To solve problems with slow services, techniques like timeouts, circuit breakers, health checks, bulkheads, load shedding, autoscaling, monitoring, and chaos engineering are used. These methods ensure the system remains reliable and resilient even when some parts fail.
