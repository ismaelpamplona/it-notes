# 4. Request Routing

Imagine you have a big restaurant with many tables, and you need to direct customers to the right table. Request routing in software is similar; it's about directing requests (like customers) to the right server or partition (like tables) to handle them.

Request routing is like making sure everyone gets to the right place. For example:

- In a restaurant, a host guides you to your table based on your reservation.
- In a library, a librarian directs you to the right section based on the book you're looking for.

In software, request routing makes sure each request goes to the right server or partition for processing.

1. **Physical and Virtual Shards:**

   - **Physical Shards:**

     - These are actual, physical servers or storage units where data is stored.
     - Think of them as real tables in a restaurant where customers can sit.

   - **Virtual Shards:**

     - These are logical partitions within a physical shard, which can be moved or reallocated without changing the physical layout.
     - Think of them as assigned seats within the tables that can be rearranged easily.

   - **Pros and Cons:**
     - **Physical Shards:** Easy to understand and manage, but harder to scale and rebalance.
     - **Virtual Shards:** More flexible and scalable, but add complexity in management.

2. **Request Routing Options:**

   - **Static Routing:**

     - Requests are routed based on predefined rules.
     - Example: Always send requests for a specific user to a designated server.
     - **Pros:** Simple and predictable.
     - **Cons:** Not flexible, can't handle changes in load dynamically.

   - **Dynamic Routing:**

     - Requests are routed based on real-time conditions.
     - Example: Send requests to the server with the least load.
     - **Pros:** Flexible and can adapt to changes in load.
     - **Cons:** More complex to implement and manage.

   - **Consistent Hashing:**

     - A special type of dynamic routing where a hash function determines the route.
     - Example: Hash the user ID to decide which server handles the request.
     - **Pros:** Even distribution of requests and easy to add/remove servers.
     - **Cons:** Can be complex to set up and manage.

   - **Load Balancing:**
     - Distributes incoming requests evenly across multiple servers.
     - Example: Round-robin, where each request is sent to the next server in line.
     - **Pros:** Ensures no single server is overloaded.
     - **Cons:** Can become a bottleneck if not managed properly.

## Summary

Request routing in software ensures that each request is directed to the right server or partition for processing. Physical shards are actual servers, while virtual shards are logical partitions within them. Different routing options include static routing, dynamic routing, consistent hashing, and load balancing, each with its own pros and cons. The choice of routing strategy depends on the system's requirements and goals.
