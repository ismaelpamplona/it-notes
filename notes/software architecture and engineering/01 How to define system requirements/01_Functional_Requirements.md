# 1. Functional Requirements

Imagine you're building a treehouse. Functional requirements are like the rules or features you need for the treehouse to work properly. They tell you what the treehouse should do.

Functional requirements are like a list of tasks your treehouse should be able to do. For example:

- The treehouse should have a ladder so you can climb up.
- It should have windows to look outside.
- It should have a door that you can open and close.

These tasks or features make sure your treehouse works the way you want it to.

## Deep Dive and Important Points:

1. **Definition:**

   - Functional requirements describe specific behaviors or functions of a system.
   - They define what the system should do, not how it should do it.

2. **Examples in Software:**

   - **User Authentication:** The system should allow users to log in with a username and password.
   - **Data Processing:** The system should process transactions within 2 seconds.
   - **Report Generation:** The system should generate monthly sales reports.

3. **Characteristics:**

   - **Specific:** They must be clear and detailed.
   - **Measurable:** You should be able to check if the requirement is met.
   - **Testable:** There should be a way to test if the requirement works.

4. **Importance:**
   - They help in planning and designing the system.
   - They ensure all necessary features are included.
   - They provide a basis for testing and validating the system.

## Summary

Functional requirements are like a list of tasks your treehouse (or software system) should do. They ensure the system works as intended by defining specific, measurable, and testable features. These requirements are crucial for planning, designing, and validating the system.
