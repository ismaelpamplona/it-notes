# 1. Batching

Imagine you're baking cookies. Instead of baking one cookie at a time, you bake a whole batch of cookies together. Batching in software works the same way. Instead of handling one request or task at a time, you handle a group of them together.

Batching is like doing many similar tasks at once to save time and effort. For example:

- Instead of sending one letter at a time, you wait until you have a bunch of letters and then send them all at once.
- Instead of washing one dish at a time, you wait until you have a sink full of dishes and then wash them all together.

In software, batching means processing multiple requests or tasks together in a single go.

1. **Pros of Batching:**

   - **Efficiency:** Saves time by reducing the number of times you start and stop a task.
   - **Performance:** Can improve performance by handling multiple tasks at once.
   - **Resource Utilization:** Makes better use of system resources like CPU and memory.

2. **Cons of Batching:**

   - **Latency:** There might be a delay because you wait to collect enough tasks to form a batch.
   - **Complexity:** Managing batches can be more complicated than handling individual tasks.
   - **Error Handling:** If one task in the batch fails, it might affect the whole batch.

3. **How to Handle Batch Requests:**

   - **Collecting Requests:** Gather multiple requests until you have a batch ready to process.
   - **Processing the Batch:** Process all the requests in the batch together.
   - **Handling Errors:** Ensure you have a way to deal with errors without affecting the whole batch.
   - **Returning Results:** Send back the results for each request in the batch.

4. **Batching Examples in Software:**

   - **Database Operations:** Instead of inserting one record at a time, insert multiple records in a single batch.
   - **Network Requests:** Send multiple API requests in one go instead of one by one.
   - **File Processing:** Process multiple files together instead of one at a time.

## Summary

Batching in software is like baking a batch of cookies â€“ it means handling multiple similar tasks together to save time and resources. While it improves efficiency and performance, it can also introduce complexity and latency. Properly managing and processing batch requests is key to leveraging the benefits of batching while minimizing its drawbacks.
