## Space Complexity
- Space complexity is defined as the process of determining a formula for prediction of how much memory in space will be required for the successful execution of the algorithm. 
- The memory space we generally consider is the space of primary memory.

## Time Complexity
- Time complexity is defined as the process of determining a formula for total time required towards execution of that algorithm. 
- This calculation will be independent of implementation details and programming language.

## Asymptotic Notation
- Used to make meaningful statements about the efficiency of algorithms.
- These notations help us to make approximately but meaningful assumptions about the time and space complexity.

### Commom used notations:
1. Big-Oh Notation(O) (upper bound)
2. Big-Omega Notation(Ω) (lower bound)
3. Big-O Notation(Θ) (tight bound)
